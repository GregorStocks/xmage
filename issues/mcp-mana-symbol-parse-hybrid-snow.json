  "title": "Parse hybrid/phyrexian/snow mana symbols in pool choice logic",
  "description": "Pool mana choice detection only checks for explicit {W}{U}{B}{R}{G}{C} symbols. Prompts with hybrid ({G/U}), phyrexian ({W/P}), or snow ({S}) symbols are treated as generic and may allow incorrect pool options or auto-select wrong colors. Expand symbol parsing to handle hybrid/phyrexian/snow tokens and restrict pool choices accordingly.",
