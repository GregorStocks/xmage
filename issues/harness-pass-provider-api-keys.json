  "title": "Pass provider-specific LLM API keys to child processes",
  "description": "The harness validates provider-specific API keys based on base_url, but start_chatterbox_client/start_pilot_client only pass OPENROUTER_API_KEY to child processes. This causes OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini configs to pass validation but fail at runtime due to missing env vars. Ensure required key envs are forwarded (or pass --api-key) based on each player's base_url.",
