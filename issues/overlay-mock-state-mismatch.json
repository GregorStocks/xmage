  "description": "The server-side mock-state.json and the JS inline inlineMockState both only define 2 players (player-1, player-2) with minimal card data. Since the primary use case is 4-player Commander, the mock data should be a realistic 4-player game with battlefield permanents, commanders, graveyards etc. so ?mock=1 mode is useful for UI development without a running game.",
