  "description": "In the video overlay, tapped cards get a CSS class 'tapped' but the visual distinction is subtle (just a slight style difference). In a real OBS overlay layered over the game video, it would be helpful to rotate tapped cards 90 degrees or add a more obvious visual indicator, since the tapped state is already visible in the underlying video capture.",
