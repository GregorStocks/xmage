  "title": "Expose non-tap mana abilities in MCP manual selection",
  "description": "Manual mana selection filters playable abilities to those containing '{T}: Add', which hides legal non-tap mana abilities (e.g., sacrifice/discard/add). This can make certain mana sources impossible to pick in MCP mode. Include non-tap mana abilities in the choice list (or use a dedicated playable-mana-abilities API) while still labeling tap sources if desired.",
