  "description": "In the video overlay (video_overlay.html) and ?positions=1 mode, card names overflow or get truncated when the card rectangle is small (e.g., commander and graveyard cards at 60x85px). Names like 'Freyalise, Llanowar's Fury' render as 'Freyali...' which is hard to read. Could use text-overflow: ellipsis more gracefully, show full name only on hover, or scale font size to fit the rectangle.",
