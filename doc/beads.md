# Beads (bd) usage

Use `bd` to track work as small, visible steps.

## Core habits
- Start every task with a bead.
- Keep one active bead at a time.
- Close beads as soon as the step is done.
- Split any bead that takes too long.
- Reopen a bead if work resumes.
- If you notice out-of-scope work that should be done, make a bead.

## Good beads
- Small, concrete, and testable.
- Named for outcomes, not intent.
- Time-boxed (aim for minutes, not hours).

## Examples
- "Add beads doc"
- "Link doc in AGENTS"
- "Verify build passes"
